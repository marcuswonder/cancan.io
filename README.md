# cancan.io - the projects app

## Introduction
cancan is a kanban-based tool to track the progress of projects. Each board has within it an unlimited number of 'big steps', within which there are an unlimited number of 'baby steps'.

As a user, you can track your big and baby step progress with your teammates, assigning responsibility of project stages.

## Getting Started
Find planning documents below:

## Unsolved Problems:
 * Admin array does not check for duplicates
 * Although CRUD operations are restricted on the back-end, there is no front-end authorisation
 * Date selectors return the day prior to selected date
 * The site is not responsive

 <br>
 <br>

## Future Enhancements:
 * Resolve unsolved problems
 * Improve UI and styling
 * Build out the logic in the model virtuals to show a more accurate picture of completeness
 * Implement front-end authorizations
 * Improve the back-end authorizations for additional flexibility
 * Sort tasks by due date
 * Add a dashboard that shows impending tasks - include functionality like identifying quick wins
 * Add a calendar of upcoming deadlines
